          “In Silicon Valley, you get this feeling that you have to be out here.
          But it’s not the only place to be. If I were starting now, I would
          have stayed in Boston. Silicon Valley is a little short-term focused
          and that bothers me.The question I ask myself like almost every day
          is, ‘Am I doing the most important thing I could be doing?’ … Unless I
          feel like I’m working on the most important problem that I can help
          with, then I’m not going to feel good about how I’m spending my time.”
